#phoneinput

A javascript input masking library that only supports 1 thing: phone numbers, and actually works pretty well on old Android browsers.

It formats numbers like this: (123) 123 - 1234

Requires that you have jquery installed and available as `window.jQuery`

Tested on IE8+, Android 4.0+, and modern browsers.

Based on code from [formance.js](http://omarshammas.github.io/formancejs) which is itself a fork of [jQuery.payment](https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment)
